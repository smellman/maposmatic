{% url "about" as about_url %}

<p>
{% blocktrans %}MapOSMatic is a project entirely developed and maintained by a
team of volunteers (see our <a href="{{about_url}}">About</a> page for
details). However, running the MapOSMatic service and making improvements to it
has various costs beyond the time of the volunteer developers.{% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
{% blocktrans %}Therefore, we are currently seeking donations to help us
funding:{% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<ul>
<li>{% blocktrans %}Participation to the transportation expenses of the
MapOSMatic developers when they gather for <i>hackfests</i> (meeting of
developers). You can read our <a href="http://news.maposmatic.org">blog</a> to
learn more about what we achieve during those hackfests. We usually implement a
huge number of improvements, new features and bug fixes during those meetings.
They take place during the holidays of the developers, and we would like to at
least compensate their travel expenses.{% endblocktrans %}</li>

{% blocktrans %}Donations can be done through the well-known <a
